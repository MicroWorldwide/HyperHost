# HyperHost
##Webservers, without servers.

HyperHost allows hosting of static websites directly from the browser using P2P WebRTC and a custom rendering framework.

Simply go to https://rationalcoding.github.io/HyperHost/ and drag n' drop the root folder of your website containing at least a **index.html** plus any Javascript, CSS, images, etc... Your website will be proccessed and displayed in your browser after some time. After that, *anyone* can access your site at the same URL. That's it.

Your site will be available so long as your browser has an uninterrupted network connection. All resources are served via a encrypted P2P connection.

##The static backend is NO MORE.
